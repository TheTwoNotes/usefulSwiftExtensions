# usefulSwiftExtensions
The intent of this repository is for easy access to various Swift extensions that I have found useful over the  years. Most are extensions that I have come up with for my own projects, others were shared with me by others. All are free for you to use as you need to help with your own Swift projects under the MIT License.

Each file initially will be a single extension for a particular Swift class. These may be broken out into more functionaly descriptive units later.
